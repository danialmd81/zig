# Anonymous Structs

The struct type may be omitted from a struct literal. These literals may coerce
to other struct types.

<CodeBlock language="zig">{AnonymousStructsLiteral}</CodeBlock>

Anonymous structs may be completely anonymous i.e. without being coerced to
another struct type.

{/* TODO: mention tuple slicing when it's implemented */}

Anonymous structs without field names may be created and are referred to as
**tuples**. These have many of the properties that arrays do; tuples can be
iterated over, indexed, can be used with the `++` and `**` operators, and have a
len field. Internally, these have numbered field names starting at `"0"`, which
may be accessed with the special syntax `@"0"` which acts as an escape for the
syntax - things inside `@""` are always recognised as identifiers.

An `inline` loop must be used to iterate over the tuple here, as the type of
each tuple field may differ.
